- [ ] Bindings should have a Bindings_Descriptor
- [ ] Uniforms should be handled in bindings, somehow
    - something similar to the texture
    - ability to set uniform after initialization (unlike textures)
- [X] Layout_Element's gl_type should be an enum
- [X] gfx.pipeline_draw_*'s Index_Type should be stored in Bindings.
- [ ] gfx.pipeline_draw_elements*'s indices should not be a rawptr
- [X] OpenGL handles should be a pointer so something instead, so if a texture is resized, a valid handle will be used
- [ ] texture_copy_1/2d should not take a Z offset
- [ ] verify that the copy functions are ok when using offsets and non DSA opengl. (I already know that it is not the same)
- [ ] texture_copy only works on DSA opengl apparently.
- [ ] glsm should take care of framebuffers
- [ ] framebuffers should support multiple color attachments.
- [ ] finish renderbuffers and integrate them with the enviroment.
- [ ] make renderbuffers use DSA opengl when MODERN_OPENGL is true
- [ ] texture_set_size_1d should not use the internal format as format
- [ ] examples: 04_hello_framebuffer
- [ ] fix older examples
- [X] gfx.Bindings should use slices and have a destructor.
- [ ] finish documentation of vx_core
- [ ] finish documentation of gfx
- [ ] the platform should use a custom key enum instead of GLFW constants
- [ ] support multisampled textures.
- [ ] make framebuffer resizable
- [ ] virtualize all gfx functions in a NICE WAY (Only public API calls)
- [X] gfx objects that allocate memory should contain an allocator
- [ ] Study OpenGL Sync Objects and implement them.
- [ ] Make a renderer (in vx_lib/utils ?) with render lists (akin to render passes).
